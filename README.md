# Project: [Hunter-And-Me](https://hunter-and-me.onrender.com/)

I was honored to be selected to participate in a web development training focused on React development, which was hosted by the Victorian Government's Digital Jobs program.
I undertook and successfully completed a solo project within 1 week after course, Hunterâ€™s Garden.

## Description

Hunter is my friend's dog. Her life changed after she started raising Hunter. She discovered her love for dogs and would be happy to look after other families' dogs. She and Hunter have a big garden suitable for pet sitting.

This project is a single- page pet-sitting service website that showcases my real-world application of theoretical knowledge. It features sections like 'Home,' 'About,' 'Contact,' and more, including a story on Hunter's growth and client reviews. Utilizing React, MUI, Chakra-UI, and AWS (deployment), the website offers a direct email contact form, social media (Facebook and Instagram) integration, and responsive design for seamless device compatibility.
